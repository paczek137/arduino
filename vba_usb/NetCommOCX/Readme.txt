The OLEAUT32.DLL file that had been included in this setup seems
to corrupt certain systems.  This should not happen (it should not
be installed unless absent).  However, there may be a bug in
InstallShield that causes a problem.  Thus, I have removed this file
from the Setup files.

I cannot test this very satisfactorily, so let me know if there are problems.

Special Note:  The Setup.pdf file found here IS NOT an Adobe Acrobat document!
It is used by InstallShield during the install process.
